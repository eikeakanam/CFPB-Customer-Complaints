## INTRODUCTION AND PROBLEM STATEMENT
___
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is a U.S. government agency saddled with the responsibility of protecting customers of financial products and services within the United States by ensuring they are treated fairly by banks, lenders and other financial institutions.

Personally, having experienced some unfair services from financial institutions (small, medium, large) in the past with either no or delayed resolutions despite prompt complaints, I found this quite quite interesting and decided to embark on the project of analyizing customer complaints as provided by CFPB for the years 2020 - 2023.

This project seeks to investigate the following observations and more:
- Trend and patterns of complaints logged by consumers over a period of time
- Companies and products most affected over the said period
- Most reported financial issues by customers
- Location of Organization and consumers with most complaints
- Major Sources / medium for submission of complaints by customers
- Level of response by Organizations to customer complaints
- Do customer complaints get resolved ? How soon do they get resolved 
- Level of satisfaction of customers with solutions provided by Organizations to their complaints
